## Email Campaign Management

The email campaign system allows users to upload lists of email addresses and send marketing campaigns in controlled batches. The system includes intelligent auto-pause functionality to prevent overwhelming recipients and maintain good sender reputation.

### How the Email Batch System Works

Understanding the batch system is crucial for using the API effectively:

1. **File Upload Process**: When a user uploads a CSV or Excel file containing email addresses, the system immediately extracts all email addresses and queues them in BullMQ for processing.

2. **Batch Configuration**: Each batch is created with specific settings including the number of emails to process before auto-pausing and the delay between individual email sends.

3. **Worker Processing**: Background workers process the queued emails one by one, respecting the configured delay between sends.

4. **Auto-Pause Mechanism**: After processing the specified number of emails (`emailsPerBatch`), the batch automatically pauses. This prevents overwhelming recipients and helps maintain good sender reputation.

5. **Database Optimization**: The system only updates the database when batch status changes (pause/complete), not after every individual email, ensuring optimal performance.

6. **Continuation Process**: Users can create additional batches for the same upload to continue processing remaining emails.

### Create Email Batch

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/emailBatch/createEmailBatch`

**Description:** Creates a new email campaign batch. This can be done either by uploading a new file containing email addresses or by creating an additional batch for an existing upload. The system supports both scenarios to provide flexibility in campaign management.

**Authentication Required:** Yes

**Headers:**
```
Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN
Content-Type: multipart/form-data (for file upload)
Content-Type: application/json (for existing upload)
```

**Option 1 - New File Upload:**

When uploading a new file, use multipart form data with the following fields:

- `file`: CSV or Excel file containing email addresses
- `batchName`: Descriptive name for this batch campaign
- `subject`: Email subject line for all emails in this batch
- `composedEmail`: HTML content of the email to be sent
- `delayBetweenEmails`: Number of seconds to wait between sending individual emails
- `emailsPerBatch`: Number of emails to process before automatically pausing the batch
- `scheduleTime`: When to start processing ("NOW" for immediate start)

**Option 2 - Existing Upload:**

For creating additional batches from previously uploaded email lists, send JSON data:

```json
{
  "uploadId": 123,
  "batchName": "Follow-up Campaign Wave 2",
  "subject": "Don't miss out on our special offer!",
  "composedEmail": "<html><body><h1>Special Offer</h1><p>Your email content here</p></body></html>",
  "delayBetweenEmails": "3",
  "emailsPerBatch": "25",
  "scheduleTime": "NOW"
}
```

**Field Requirements:**
- `batchName`: 3-50 characters, descriptive name for tracking
- `subject`: 3-50 characters, email subject line
- `composedEmail`: 10-10000 characters, HTML email content
- `delayBetweenEmails`: String representing seconds (e.g., "2" for 2 seconds)
- `emailsPerBatch`: String representing number (1-100)
- `scheduleTime`: Currently supports "NOW" for immediate processing

**File Requirements:**
- **Supported Formats**: CSV (.csv), Excel (.xlsx, .xls)
- **Maximum Size**: 10 MB per file
- **Required Structure**: Must contain a column named "email" with valid email addresses
- **Optional Columns**: firstName, lastName, or other custom fields

**What Happens Internally:**

When a batch is created, the following process occurs:

1. If uploading a file, all email addresses are extracted and immediately queued in BullMQ
2. A batch record is created in the database with the specified settings
3. The `totalEmailSentToQueue` field is updated with the total number of emails queued
4. Background workers begin processing emails with the specified delay between sends
5. After processing the specified number of emails (`emailsPerBatch`), the batch automatically pauses

## Batch Status System

Understanding the different batch statuses is important for monitoring campaign progress and taking appropriate actions.

### Status Meanings

**pending**: The batch has been created and configured, but background workers have not yet started processing the emails. This is a temporary status that usually changes to "processing" within seconds.

**processing**: Background workers are actively sending emails from this batch. Emails are being processed one by one with the configured delay between sends. The batch will automatically change to "paused" when it reaches the `emailsPerBatch` limit.

**paused**: The batch has automatically paused after processing the configured number of emails (`emailsPerBatch`). This is the system's intelligent throttling mechanism to prevent overwhelming recipients and maintain good sender reputation. Users can create additional batches to continue processing.

**completed**: All emails assigned to this specific batch have been successfully processed. This means the batch has finished its designated work. Note that there may still be unprocessed emails in the original upload that require additional batches.

**failed**: The batch encountered an error during processing and has stopped. This could be due to various issues such as email service problems, configuration errors, or system failures.

### Auto-Pause System Explanation

The auto-pause system is a key feature that provides intelligent email sending control:

1. **Initial Setup**: User creates a batch with `emailsPerBatch: 50` setting
2. **Queue Population**: All emails from the upload are immediately queued in BullMQ
3. **Worker Processing**: Background workers begin processing emails one by one with the specified delay
4. **Redis Tracking**: The system tracks `processedCount` in Redis, incrementing after each email is sent
5. **Auto-Pause Trigger**: When `processedCount` reaches 50 (the configured limit):
   - Worker resets the counter to 0 in Redis
   - Worker sets the Redis `paused` flag to true
   - Worker updates the database batch status to "paused"
6. **Processing Halt**: The batch stops processing automatically
7. **Continuation**: User can create a new batch for the same upload to continue with remaining emails

This system provides precise control over email sending rates, helps prevent being flagged as spam, and allows for strategic campaign pacing.

### Pause Email Batch

**Endpoint:** `PATCH /api/v1/emailBatch/pauseBatch/:batchId`

**Description:** Pauses an active email batch. This stops the background workers from processing more emails for this specific batch while preserving the current state. The batch can be resumed later with the same or updated settings.

**Authentication Required:** Yes

**Headers:**
```
Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN
```

**URL Parameters:**
- `batchId`: The unique UUID identifier of the batch to pause

**Example URL:**
- `/api/v1/emailBatch/pauseBatch/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`

**Success Response (HTTP 200):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Batch 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 paused",
  "data": null
}
```

**What Happens Internally:**
1. Sets the Redis `paused` flag to `true` for the batch
2. Updates the database batch status to "paused"
3. Background workers will stop processing emails for this batch
4. Processed count and batch state are preserved

**Error Responses:**
- **HTTP 401**: Authentication token missing or invalid
- **HTTP 404**: Batch ID not found
- **HTTP 500**: Internal server error

### Resume Email Batch

**Endpoint:** `PATCH /api/v1/emailBatch/resumeBatch/:batchId`

**Description:** Resumes a paused email batch. This reactivates the background workers to continue processing emails from where they left off. The batch will use its current configuration settings.

**Authentication Required:** Yes

**Headers:**
```
Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN
```

**URL Parameters:**
- `batchId`: The unique UUID identifier of the batch to resume

**Example URL:**
- `/api/v1/emailBatch/resumeBatch/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`

**Success Response (HTTP 200):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Batch 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 resumed",
  "data": null
}
```

**What Happens Internally:**
1. Sets the Redis `paused` flag to `false` for the batch
2. Updates the database batch status to "processing"
3. Background workers resume processing emails for this batch
4. Processing continues from the preserved state

**Error Responses:**
- **HTTP 401**: Authentication token missing or invalid
- **HTTP 404**: Batch ID not found
- **HTTP 500**: Internal server error

---

## Batch Management Workflow

The system now supports a single-batch-per-upload model with pause/resume functionality:

### Initial Batch Creation
1. **Upload File**: User uploads a CSV/Excel file with email addresses
2. **Batch Creation**: System creates a single batch and queues all emails
3. **Auto-Processing**: Background workers start processing with configured settings
4. **Auto-Pause**: After processing the configured number of emails, batch auto-pauses

### Continuing with Existing Upload
1. **Resume Batch**: Use the same `createEmailBatch` endpoint with `uploadId`
2. **Update Settings**: Provide new batch settings (name, subject, content, timing)
3. **Smart Resume**: System updates the existing batch and resumes processing
4. **Flexible Control**: Users can pause/resume at any time with dedicated endpoints

### Manual Control
- **Pause**: Use `/pauseBatch/:batchId` to temporarily stop processing
- **Resume**: Use `/resumeBatch/:batchId` to continue from where it left off
- **Update & Resume**: Use `/createEmailBatch` with `uploadId` to update settings and resume

This approach provides better control over email sending while maintaining the intelligent auto-pause system for sender reputation management.

## Error Response Format

All API endpoints follow a consistent error response format to ensure predictable error handling.

**Standard Error Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "status": 400,
  "message": "Detailed error description explaining what went wrong",
  "data": null
}
```

### HTTP Status Codes

**200 OK**: Request successful, data retrieved or operation completed successfully

**201 Created**: Resource created successfully (user registration, batch creation)

**400 Bad Request**: Invalid request data, validation errors, or business logic violations. The message field will contain specific details about what was invalid.

**401 Unauthorized**: Authentication token is missing, invalid, or expired. The user needs to log in again or provide a valid token.

**403 Forbidden**: The authenticated user does not have sufficient privileges for the requested operation. For example, non-admin users trying to access admin-only endpoints.

**404 Not Found**: The requested resource does not exist. This could be a non-existent upload ID, batch ID, or user.

**500 Internal Server Error**: An unexpected error occurred on the server. These errors are logged for investigation and should be reported if they persist.
